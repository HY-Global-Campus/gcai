# CreateChatCompletionRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**messages** | [**Vec<models::ChatCompletionRequestMessage>**](ChatCompletionRequestMessage.md) | A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the [model](/docs/models) you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like [text](/docs/guides/text-generation), [images](/docs/guides/vision), and [audio](/docs/guides/audio).  | 
**model** | [**models::CreateChatCompletionRequestModel**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_model.md) |  | 
**store** | Option<**bool**> | Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in our [model distillation](/docs/guides/distillation) or [evals](/docs/guides/evals) products.  | [optional][default to false]
**metadata** | Option<**std::collections::HashMap<String, String>**> | Developer-defined tags and values used for filtering completions in the [dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/chat-completions).  | [optional]
**frequency_penalty** | Option<**f64**> | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.  [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation)  | [optional][default to 0]
**logit_bias** | Option<**std::collections::HashMap<String, i32>**> | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.  | [optional]
**logprobs** | Option<**bool**> | Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`. | [optional][default to false]
**top_logprobs** | Option<**i32**> | An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used. | [optional]
**max_tokens** | Option<**i32**> | The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.  This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not compatible with [o1 series models](/docs/guides/reasoning).  | [optional]
**max_completion_tokens** | Option<**i32**> | An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and [reasoning tokens](/docs/guides/reasoning).  | [optional]
**n** | Option<**i32**> | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs. | [optional][default to 1]
**modalities** | Option<**Vec<String>**> | Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:  `[\"text\"]`  The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to [generate audio](/docs/guides/audio). To request that this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:  `[\"text\", \"audio\"]`  | [optional]
**prediction** | Option<[**models::CreateChatCompletionRequestPrediction**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_prediction.md)> |  | [optional]
**audio** | Option<[**models::CreateChatCompletionRequestAudio**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_audio.md)> |  | [optional]
**presence_penalty** | Option<**f64**> | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.  [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation)  | [optional][default to 0]
**response_format** | Option<[**models::CreateChatCompletionRequestResponseFormat**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_response_format.md)> |  | [optional]
**seed** | Option<**i32**> | This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.  | [optional]
**service_tier** | Option<**String**> | Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:   - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.   - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.   - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.   - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.    When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` utilized.  | [optional][default to Auto]
**stop** | Option<[**models::CreateChatCompletionRequestStop**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_stop.md)> |  | [optional]
**stream** | Option<**bool**> | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).  | [optional][default to false]
**stream_options** | Option<[**models::ChatCompletionStreamOptions**](ChatCompletionStreamOptions.md)> |  | [optional]
**temperature** | Option<**f64**> | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.  We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.  | [optional][default to 1]
**top_p** | Option<**f64**> | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.  | [optional][default to 1]
**tools** | Option<[**Vec<models::ChatCompletionTool>**](ChatCompletionTool.md)> | A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.  | [optional]
**tool_choice** | Option<[**models::ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption**](ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption.md)> |  | [optional]
**parallel_tool_calls** | Option<**bool**> | Whether to enable [parallel function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use. | [optional][default to true]
**user** | Option<**String**> | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).  | [optional]
**function_call** | Option<[**models::CreateChatCompletionRequestFunctionCall**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_function_call.md)> |  | [optional]
**functions** | Option<[**Vec<models::ChatCompletionFunctions>**](ChatCompletionFunctions.md)> | Deprecated in favor of `tools`.  A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.  | [optional]
